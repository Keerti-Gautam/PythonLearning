# ClassName `is-a` object?

What happened is Python's original rendition of class was broken in many serious ways.
By the time they admitted the fault it was too late, and they had to support it.
In order to fix the problem, they needed some "new class" style so that the "old classes" would keep working but you could use the new more correct version.

This is where "class is-a object" comes in.
They decided that they would use the word "object," lowercased, to be the "class" that you inherit from to make a class.
Confusing, right?
A class inherits from the class named object to make a class but it's not an object really it's a class, but do not forget to inherit from object.
