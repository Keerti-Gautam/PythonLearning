# Map, Filter and Reduce

These are three functions which facilitate a functional approach to programming.
Functional programming is all about expressions. We may say that the Functional programming is an [expression oriented programming](http://www.bogotobogo.com/python/python_fncs_map_filter_reduce.php).

## Maps
`map` applies a function to all the items in an input_list.

*Syntax*: `map(function_to_apply, list_of_inputs)`

Most of the times we want to pass all the list elements to a function one-by-one and then collect the output. For instance:

    items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    squared = []
    for i in items:
    squared.append(i**2)

Map allows us to implement this in a much simpler and nicer way like:

    items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    squared = list(map(lambda x: x**2, items))

Instead of a list of inputs we can even have a list of functions!

    def multiply(x):
      return (x*x)
    def add(x):
      return (x+x)

    funcs = [multiply, add]
    for i in range(5):
      value = list(map(lambda x: x(i), funcs))
      print(value)

      Output:
      [0, 0]
      [1, 2]
      [4, 4]
      [9, 6]
      [16, 8]

# Filter

`filter` creates a list of elements for which a function returns true. Here is a short and concise example:

    number_list = range(-5, 5)
    less_than_zero = list(filter(lambda x: x < 0, number_list))
    print(less_than_zero)

    Output: [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1]

The filter resembles a for loop but it is a built-in function and faster.

# Reduce

`reduce` is a really useful function for performing some computation on a list and returning the result.
It applies a rolling computation to sequential pairs of values in a list. For example, if you wanted to compute the product of a list of integers.

So the normal way you might go about doing this task in python is using a basic for loop:

    product = 1
    list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    for num in list:
      product = product * num

      Output: product = 24

Now letâ€™s try it with reduce:

    from functools import reduce
    product = reduce((lambda x, y: x * y), [1, 2, 3, 4])
    Output: 24
